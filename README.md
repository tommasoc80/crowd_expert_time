# Crowd vs Experts

Data used for the comparison of event and temporal expression annotation between crowd and experts.

The EN/ folder contains data for event, timex, and *temporal relations* annotation by the crowd annotation by the crowd - including and excluding potential spammers accrding to the CrowdTruth metric.

The IT/ folder contains data for event, timex, and temporal relations annotation by the crowd - including and excluding potential spammers accrding to the CrowdTruth metric.

Expert data can be retrieved from the original annotated data.

    abstract = "This paper describes two sets of crowdsourcing experiments on temporal information annotation conducted on two languages, i.e., English and Italian. The first experiment, launched on the CrowdFlower platform, was aimed at classifying temporal relations given target entities. The second one, relying on the CrowdTruth metric, consisted in two subtasks: one devoted to the recognition of events and temporal expressions and one to the detection and classification of temporal relations. The outcomes of the experiments suggest a valuable use of crowdsourcing annotations also for a complex task like Temporal Processing.",
